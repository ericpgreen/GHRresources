## Syllabus

### Instructional Team

**Instructor**: Eric Green, Ph.D., Duke University

**Teaching Assistant**: TBA

### Overview

This course will introduce you to research designs and methods in global health. Global health is a multi-disciplinary field, so we will consider approaches common to the behavioral and social sciences, public health, and medicine.

Our primary interest will be the study of causal inference. In global health, we are often interested in knowing what treatments, programs, interventions, and policies “work” and why. To answer questions of impact, we often turn to randomized controlled trials, a mainstay of medical research. As such, we will spend time exploring the rationale, process, and limitations of field experiments.

Randomization is not always possible or advisable, however, and researchers must build a causal argument using non-experimental methods. We will review several approaches, consider relevant threats to causal inference, and discuss how to improve non-experimental research designs.

Along the way, we will cover research basics, such as asking evidence-based research questions, searching the literature, developing a theory of change, identifying indicators and collecting data, selecting research participants, and testing hypotheses. In the latter part of the course, we will turn to more specialized topics in global health research, such as writing research proposals and manuscripts, economic analyses, and making an impact.

### Course Goals and Learning Objectives

We have two broad goals this semester:

1. to make you a better consumer of research, and
2. to prepare you to contribute to research teams at Duke and beyond.

<br>

The course is divided into six modules:

1. Getting started
2. Define study aims
3. Select a research design
4. Specify your methods
5. Practice good science
6. Make an impact with your work

<br>

By the end of the semester, you should be able to:

* Ask a good research question
* Effectively search the literature and make use of systematic reviews and meta-analyses
* Critically appraise scientific work
* Understand the fundamental challenge of causal inference
* Develop a theory of change
* Identify indicators to measure throughout the causal chain
* Select the best method of data collection given study objectives and resources
* Evaluate the reliability and validity of study instruments
* Devise a sampling strategy to meet study objectives and resources
* Design a high-powered study
* Articulate the benefits and limitations of random assignment
* Explain the logic and limitations of different quasi-experimental and observational designs that can be used when randomization is not possible or ethical
* Write a study protocol
* Explain how an economic analysis can put “treatment effects” in context
* Make a plan to promote the use of research in policymaking

### Class Format

Each class session has a dedicated tutorial page that introduces the session and explains how to prepare for class. Class sessions will typically begin with a brief lecture designed to reinforce or extend pre-class learning, but the aim is to spend most of the in-class time on application activities. Activities will be based on assigned readings and will incorporate the use of tools like R/RStudio. Please review the activity before class, just as you might prepare for a lab in biology or chemistry.

### Resources

The main course text is [*Global Health Research: Designs and Methods*](https://themethodsection.com/). You can read it online for free, download a PDF, or get a version for iBooks. I do not recommend reading on a mobile device unless you use the iBooks version.

### Workload

A reasonable rule of thumb is somewhere between 2:1 and 3:1 out-of-class to in-class hours. At the upper end, this is about 100 hours of outside class time this semester.

### Evaluation

Your final grade will be a weighted average of several components: application activities, homework, a midterm exam, and a study proposal.

**In-class application activities**: Short activities designed to be completed in class in groups of 2-3. Pass/fail.

**Homework**: Assignments generally due one week after the end of the module.

**Midterm**: There will be an in-class midterm exam. Multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer questions.

**Study proposal**: Your study proposal will take the place of the final exam. Details on format and process will be provided.

| Component                             | Weight |
|:----                                   |:--:    |
| In-class application activities       | 20%    |
| Homework                              | 20%    |
| Midterm                               | 25%    |
| Study proposal                        | 35%    |

Ranges for letter grades will be set at the end of the semester, and grades may be curved. Cumulative scores of at least 90, 80, and 70 will be guaranteed at least an A-, B-, and C-, respectively. 

### Getting Help

Getting help is easy. Try the following, in order of priority:

1. Ask a question in class.
2. Post a question to Piazza. This is a great platform that turns your questions and answers into public goods. We'll strive to answer every question within hours (often minutes). You can post anonymously to your peers if desired, so there really are no "dumb" questions.
3. If you need additional help after trying #1 and #2, attend office hours or set up individual or small-group meetings. 

Please limit your emails to personal matters that are not appropriate for class or Piazza. "I don't understand power calculations" is not a personal matter. Emails like this will probably go unanswered, whereas Piazza messages will be rewarded with snappy replies since they benefit everyone.

### Policies

Please note the following:

* If you miss an in-class **application activity**, you will have until the start of the next class to contact the TA and submit your completed work. After this time, you will receive a score of 0 unless you have permission to follow a different schedule. [See here](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/class-attendance-and-missed-work) for more details about Duke's policies regarding class attendance and missed work.
* **Homework** will be due at the start of class on the date indicated on the schedule. Late submissions will penalized 5 percentage points. For every 24 hours late after the missed deadline, an additional 5 percentage points will be deducted from the score.
* Students should abide by the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) at all times. If a questionable circumstance arises, do not hesitate to seek my guidance (before is always better than after).
* Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations should speak with me during the first two weeks of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Students with disabilities will also need to contact the [Student Disability Access Office](http://www.access.duke.edu/students/requesting/index.php).
